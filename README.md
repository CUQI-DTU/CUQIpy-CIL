# CUQIpy-CIL

CUQIpy-CIL is a plugin for the [CUQIpy](https://github.com/CUQI-DTU/CUQIpy) software package.

It adds a thin wrapper around Computed Tomography (CT) forward models from [CIL](https://github.com/TomographicImaging/CIL).

Currently it requires the user to manually install the CIL and CUQIpy packages.

CUQIpy can be placed next to the CIL package in the same directory.
